    "\n",
    "The lyrics site, www.azlyrics.com, does not have an explicit maximum on number of requests in any one time, but in our testing it appears that too many requests in too short a time will cause the site to stop returning lyrics pages. (Entertainingly, the page that gets returned seems to only have the song title to [a Tom Jones song](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomjones/itsnotunusual.html).) \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you call `requests.get` to retrieve a page, put a `time.sleep(5 + 10*random.random())` on the next line. This will help you not to get blocked. If you _do_ get blocked, which you can identify if the returned pages are not correct, just request a lyrics page through your browser. You'll be asked to perform a CAPTCHA and then your requests should start working again. \n",

    "A: The robot.txt file suggests that all bots are prohibited from accessing or scraping both the /lyricsdb/ and /song/ directory. The robot.txt file also specifies a certain user agent that is not allowed to scrape any part of the website. This means that the scraping that is about to be performed is allowed as the content will come from the root directory or other areas that are not explicitly stated as disallowed. \n"
